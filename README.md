# SoCharM
SoCharM is an application written primarily in Python that seeks to create a robust, general self-organizing mapper that can take an input vector of characters with n-dimensional quantitative features, and map those n-dimensional features to a 2-dimensional output space of character clusters, where proximity of clusters indicates greater likelihood of similarity of features of its members.    The original inspiration for this idea came when I was playing a game of Overwatch, and thinking to myself that the character classifications chosen by the game's developers felt unsatisfying. My intuition was that the origin of this unsatisfaction was that the selected clustering was not the most effective (understanding that this is a slightly abstract and subjective quality metric).  I intend to extend this project over 3 popular games which fit fairly nicely into the application use case: League of Legends, Overwatch, and DOTA 2 (perhaps even HotS if I'm feeling feisty). The hope is that this application will 1) give developers potentially insightful feedback into the quality of their classification selection and 2)  expose an API that would allow the player community to use this info to help make guides, give players a new perspective on characters and their relationships to others, and pretty just to play around with for fun.  But the third and main goal is to just have fun with the project and learn some cool stuff :)
